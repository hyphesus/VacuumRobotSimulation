# Autonomous Vacuum Robot Simulation

This project simulates a 2D autonomous vacuum robot. The robot explores an environment, avoids obstacles, and cleans uncleaned areas. After completing the cleaning process, the robot returns to its starting point.

## Features

- Environment exploration using BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Obstacle detection and marking cleaned areas
- Systematic cleaning using a lawnmower pattern
- Shortest pathfinding with A* algorithm
- User can reset the map using the "Regenerate Map" button
